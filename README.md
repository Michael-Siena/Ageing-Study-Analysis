# Ageing Study
This repository contains some example code used to process and analyse data collected for research investigating the effects of normal ageing on parietal grey matter volume and spatial memory perspective. 

The main analysis centered on linear mixed effects modelling. Deviation coding was employed to enable an ANOVA-like interpretation of main effects/interactions. Key variables of interest were mean spatial memory performance measures (including an accuracy percentile relative to randomly generated reponse distribution of all possible responses) and median response time. While the original intent was to model the raw data to take full advantage of mixed effects modelling, the final analysis fell back on modelling the aggregate data due to model convergence failures (most likely due to the raw data being insufficient to support the desired model complexity). 

Note that these materials have intentionally been left incomplete as this research is still ongoing.
