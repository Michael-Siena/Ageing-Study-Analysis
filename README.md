# Ageing Study
This repository contains some example code used to process and analyse data collected for research investigating the effects of normal ageing on parietal grey matter volume and spatial memory perspective. 

The main analysis centered on linear mixed effects modelling. Deviation coding was employed to enable an ANOVA-like interpretation of main effects/interactions. Key variables of interest were mean spatial memory performance measures (including an accuracy percentile relative to randomly generated reponse distribution of all possible responses) and median response time.

Note that these materials have intentionally been left incomplete as this research has been extended.
